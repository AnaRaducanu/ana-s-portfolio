          Hello, there! I'm Ana, a junior software developer enthusiast who
          loves cracking code puzzles and playing hide-and-seek in the code. You
          could say I'm a bit of a code detective!Â

        <p>
          During my previous role as a sales and marketing analyst, I discovered
          a passion for the technical aspects, specifically in debugging errors
          and comprehending code while utilizing macros with the developer tab
          option.

          While on maternity leave, I seized the opportunity to embark on a

          , a rigorous boot camp designed to facilitate the transition of
          individuals from diverse backgrounds into the tech field. It was like
          a rollercoaster ride, thrilling and intense and I successfully
          completed the program, equipping myself with valuable skills and
          knowledge.

          Now, I'm excited to contribute my analytical and problem-solving
          skills to a mission-driven team. When I'm not immersed in code, you
          might find me enjoying a scoop of ice cream, exploring the world of
          paint by numbers, or diving into a good book on how to negociate with
          your toddler :).
